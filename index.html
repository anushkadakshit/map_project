		<p>Datasets on <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/income-inequality-by-state">income inequality in the U.S in 2021</a> and the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/americas-swing-2024-wide-deep/story?id=116639076"> red shift from 2020 to the 2024 presidential election</a> shows that there tended to be a greater shift towards the Republican Party in states that have a higher rate of income inequality. 
		</p>

		<p>New York, the state with the highest income inequality, had the greatest shift toward Trump in 2024 compared to 2020. States like Utah and Maine have lower rates of income inequality, and saw the lowest shift towards Trump. 
		</p>

		<p><a href="https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/people/mccall-leslie/"> Leslie McCall</a>, a professor of sociology and political science at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at CUNY, says that it's really the economic circumstances of the working and middle class that affects their support for politicians.</p>

		<p>"Neither party has addressed the issue of inequality in the sense that it has been able to reduce levels of inequality and increase levels of economic well-being among the poor, working and middle classes," said McCall. "Republicans are seen as focusing more on economic issues than Democrats, so people feel that they might as well give the party out of power a chance for change."</p>

		<p> McCall thinks that frustrations with low wages in poor areas and high costs of living in rich areas contributed to the 2024 election, regardless of whether either party will be able to deliver. </p>
